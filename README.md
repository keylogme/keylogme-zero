<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The end goal is to avoid or diminish the pain in your hands due to typing. Commonly known as RSI (Repetitive Strain Injury), 
tennis elbow, carpal tunnel syndrome, etc.

There are many great ergonomic keyboards , beautiful hardware out there. However, what is the layout of keys 
that best suits you? that does not cause you pain? that makes you more productive?.

We all started with QWERTY, then heard of DVORAK, COLEMAK, Workman, Norman, Asset, Capewell-Dvorak, BEAKL, MTGAP, QGMLWB... ?
There are many layouts but switching to one is not an easy task, you need a lot of practice and patience.


Here's how:
* Monitor : See the finger usage on your layout based on your real usage
* Analyze : Compare your layout with others, find patterns to avoid or improve, remap shortcuts
* Adapt : fine tune your layout based on the stats

Of course, ergonomics is not just a nice keyboard and layout. It is also about posture, breaks, exercises.
